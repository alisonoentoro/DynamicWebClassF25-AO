                    Sunset Pomodoro is an interactive timer that shifts with time and place. As you select a city, 
                    the background transforms into its own sunset gradient, slowly fading from light to dark as the 
                    timer runs. Itâ€™s a calm, visual way to stay grounded and present while you work, inspired by the 
                    passing light of the day.
