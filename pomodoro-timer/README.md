# Sunset Pomodoro (Midterm)

Sunset Pomodoro is an interactive timer that shifts with time and place. As you select a city, the background transforms into its own sunset gradient, slowly fading from light to dark as the timer runs. Itâ€™s a calm, visual way to stay grounded and present while you work, inspired by the passing light of the day.

## Key Features and Functionality
1. Standard Pomodoro Timer: The default timer is 25 minutes.

2. Customizable Time: Users can change the working time in the settings, ranging from 5 to 60 minutes (in intervals of 5 minutes). This is reflected on the main pomodoro page upon saving.

3. Gradient Background: A dynamic, sunset-themed gradient effect is created for each city location using the Granim.js library.
