            <p>Sunset Pomodoro is an interactive timer that shifts with time and place. As you select a city, the background transforms into its own sunset gradient, slowly fading from light to dark as the timer runs. It&rsquo;s a calm, visual way to stay grounded and present while you work, inspired by the passing light of the day.</p>
